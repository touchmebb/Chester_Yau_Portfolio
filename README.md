# This is my portfolio, where I share my data science projects and my interest in Mathematics :)

# [Project 1: Stock market movement prediction](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20-%20Stock%20Market%20direction%20predictions.ipynb)
* Given a dataset which contains information about the S&P stock index from 2001 to 2005, examine the data.
* Fit a logistic model over the data and test with different training and testing data sets.
* State why accuracy tends to be relatively low in stock market prediction models.
* Found a trading strategy according to the accuracy of the model best fitted.

# [Project 2: E-sports membership subscription](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Time-Series%20analysis%20Project%20-%20E-sports%20membership%20subscription.ipynb)
* Check the dataset to see if it is clean
* Apply different techniques to minimize variance fluctuation.
* Used Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to show the data is time dependent 
* Fitted the best time-series model to the data according to ACF, PACF and EACF.
* Forecasted the short-term and long-term membership subscriptions.
* Stated the limitations of time-series models and how to deal with it.
