<h1>Nice to meet you, my name is Chester</h1>

This is my portfolio, where I share my data science projects and my interest in Mathematics :) I am a mathematics student with graduate level mathematics reseach experience. 

My recently research direction is in C*-algebras and topological data analysis. The latter helps me in understand data structure in a metric that is rarely used in data science.

# ==Data science projects section==

# [Data Science Project 1: Stock market movement prediction](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Stock%20Market%20direction%20predictions.ipynb)
* Given a dataset which contains information about the S&P stock index from 2001 to 2005, examine the data.
* Fit logistic models and KNN over the data and test with different training and testing data sets.
* State why accuracy tends to be relatively low in most stock market prediction models.
* Found a trading strategy according to the accuracy of the model best fitted.

# [Data Science Project 2: E-sports membership subscription](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Time-Series%20analysis%20Project%20-%20E-sports%20membership%20subscription.ipynb)
* Check the dataset to see if it is clean
* Apply different techniques to minimize variance fluctuation.
* Used Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to show the data is time dependent 
* Fitted the best time-series model to the data according to ACF, PACF and EACF.
* Forecasted the short-term and long-term membership subscriptions.
* Stated the limitations of time-series models and how to deal with it.

# [Data Science Project 3: Heart disease diagnosis](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Heart%20disease%20identifying%20peoject.ipynb)
* Predict whether an individual has heart disease
* Data cleaning from raw files
* Support vector Machines used
* Fit SVM models with different tuning variables and somewhat corelated variables

# [Data Science Project 4: Breast Cancer diagnosis](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Wisconsin%20Breast%20Cancer%20Diagnostic.ipynb)
* This project aims to train a model to correctly diagnose malignant tumor.
* Used neural networks
* Data cleaning
* 98% accuracy and 97% true positive rate.

# [Data Science Project 5: Australia international students forecast](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Australia%20students%20forecast%20.ipynb)
* This project aims to model the number of international students and give forecasts on upcoming students commencing in 2021
* Used time-series models
* Data cleaning
* Predicted number of students to fall by 30%.

# Data Science Project 6:
* The motivation of this project is due to myself suffering from ruptured ACL and torn meniscus3 years ago and only the latter was diagnosised by all the physiotherapists I saw over this 3 years. Both got diagnosised right away with a MRI scan. I want to model MRI on diagnosising and classifying knee injuries.
* To be updated

# [Applied Bayesian project: Applying MCMC methods to asset price models](https://github.com/touchmebb/Chester_Yau_Portfolio/blob/main/Applying%20MCMC%20to%20asset%20pricing%20models.ipynb)
* MCMC is a method to sample a distribution when there is no known distribution
* This paper aims provide a method, namely the famous Independence Metropolis-Hasting algoriothm to obtain a dependent sample of the state space model.
